# Peeps: A demo of JSONAPI-Resources

Peeps is a very basic contact management system implemented as an API that follows the JSON API spec.

## No really, What is this?

This project demonstrates how to use JSON API Resources with a NoSQL, ActiveModel replacement **without** ActiveRecord.

In this case, the demo uses Mongoid and MongoDB. In theory, NoBrainer and RethinkDB would also work with a few adjustments.

## Areas of Opportunity

This demo patches JSON API ResourceController to avoid using `ActiveRecord`. (see https://github.com/cerebris/jsonapi-resources/issues/51)

```ruby
<<<<<<< HEAD
class ApplicationController < JSONAPI::ResourceController
  # Prevent CSRF attacks by raising an exception.
  # For APIs, you may want to use :null_session instead.
  protect_from_forgery with: :null_session
end
```

### Configure Development Environment
Edit config/environments/development.rb

Eager loading of classes is recommended. The code will work without it, but I think it's the right way to go.
See http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2012/08/eager-loading-for-greater-good/

```ruby
  # Eager load code on boot so JSONAPI-Resources resources are loaded and processed globally
  config.eager_load = true
```

```ruby
config.consider_all_requests_local       = false
```

This will prevent the server from returning the HTML formatted error messages when an exception happens. Not strictly
necessary, but it makes for nicer output when debugging using curl or a client library.

## Now let's put some meat into the app

### Create Models for our data
Use the standard rails generator to create a model for Contacts and one for related PhoneNumbers

```bash
rails g model Contact name_first:string name_last:string email:string twitter:string
```

Edit the model
```ruby
class Contact < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :phone_numbers

  ### Validations
  validates :name_first, presence: true
  validates :name_last, presence: true

end
```

Create the PhoneNumber model
```bash
rails g model PhoneNumber contact_id:integer name:string phone_number:string
```

Edit it

```ruby
class PhoneNumber < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :contact
end
```

### Migrate the DB

```bash
rake db:migrate
```

### Create Controllers
Use the rails generator to create empty controllers. These will be inherit methods from the ResourceController so
they will know how to respond to the standard REST methods.

```bash
rails g controller Contacts --skip-assets
rails g controller PhoneNumbers --skip-assets
```

### Create our resources directory

We need a directory to hold our resources. Let's put in under our app directory

```bash
mkdir app/resources
```

### Create the resources

Create a new file for each resource. This must be named in a standard way so it can be found. This should be the single
underscored name of the model with \_resource.rb appended. For Contacts this will be contact_resource.rb.

Make the two resource files

contact_resource.rb

```ruby
class ContactResource < JSONAPI::Resource
  attributes :name_first, :name_last, :email, :twitter
  has_many :phone_numbers
end
```

and phone_number_resource.rb

```ruby
class PhoneNumberResource < JSONAPI::Resource
  attributes :name, :phone_number
  has_one :contact

  filter :contact
end

```

### Setup routes

Add the routes for the new resources

```ruby
jsonapi_resources :contacts
jsonapi_resources :phone_numbers
```
=======
module JSONAPI
  class ResourceController

    def create_operations_processor
      JSONAPI::OperationsProcessor.new
    end

  end
end
```

Record filtering relies on ActiveRecord to turn `records.where` into an `IN` query in SQL. This needs an adjustment (not currently included) to enable filtering in Mongoid. (see https://github.com/cerebris/jsonapi-resources/issues/118)
>>>>>>> Peeps without ActiveRecord (using Mongoid)

Some error handling tries to catch/rescue `ActiveRecord` errors like `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound`. Sadly, `rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound => e` throws an error because `ActiveRecord` isn't loaded. (see https://github.com/cerebris/jsonapi-resources/issues/127)

## Test it out

Start a mongo instance with `mongod`.

Launch the app

```bash
rails server
```

Create a new contact
```bash
curl -i -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json" -H 'Content-Type:application/vnd.api+json' -X POST -d '{"data": {"type":"contacts", "name-first":"John", "name-last":"Doe", "email":"john.doe@boring.test"}}' http://localhost:3000/contacts
```

You should get something like this back
```

{"data":{"id":"1","name-first":"John","name-last":"Doe","email":"john.doe@boring.test","twitter":null,"type":"contacts","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/contacts/1","phone-numbers":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/contacts/1/links/phone-numbers","related":"http://localhost:3000/contacts/1/phone-numbers"}}}}

```

You can now create a phone number for this contact

```
curl -i -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json" -H 'Content-Type:application/vnd.api+json' -X POST -d '{"data": {"type":"phone-numbers", "links": {"contact": {"linkage": {"type": "contacts", "id":"1"}}}, "name":"home", "phone-number":"(603) 555-1212"}}' "http://localhost:3000/phone-numbers"
```

And you should get back something like this:

```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created

```

You can now query all one of your contacts

```bash
curl -i -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json" "http://localhost:3000/contacts"
```

And you get this back:

```

```

Note that the phone_number id is included in the links, but not the details of the phone number. You can get these by
setting an include:

```bash
curl -i -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json" "http://localhost:3000/contacts?include=phone-numbers"
```

and some fields:
```bash
curl -i -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json" "http://localhost:3000/contacts?include=phone-numbers&fields%5Bcontacts%5D=name-first,name-last&fields%5Bphone-numbers%5D=name"
```

Test a validation Error
```bash
curl -i -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json" -H 'Content-Type:application/vnd.api+json' -X POST -d '{"data": {"type":"contacts", "name-first":"John Doe", "email":"john.doe@boring.test"}}' http://localhost:3000/contacts
```
